# myapp

A new Flutter project that shows users healthy foods that they could purchase through my app

This app only has a gui and is not connected to a server

## Tutorial

This project was inspired by Raja Yogan

When making this app I followed Raja for the most part and added some customization so I could call it my app

## Getting Started

First make a directory for which you will be saving the app

Next cd into the directory and copy **git clone https://github.com/Ljtron/flutterTutorial0.git

After the git repository is done downloading start an emulator either android or ios

Lastly in the command line type flutter get, flutter run
